Using Visual C++ and your OpenGL configured environment,
write an application that displays a “unique” graphical scene that you designed and coded for this course. 

What you put in your graphical scene is up to you. There are some specific requirements, however.

All submissions must include the following:

X 1. Use a 800 x 600 display window
X 2. Include the Window title of “Your name – Homework 2” on your display.
3. Include lines, rectangles, triangles and other polygon shapes of your choice.
4. Include multiple text elements within the graphic.
X 5. Include a unique 24x24 or larger bitmap image that you designed and generated. The bitmap image may be displayed multiple times in the scene as needed.

Notes:

1. Work to be creative and make this your own.
2. Consider generating a scene with animals, fish, houses, city skylines, furniture, flowers or other objects you want to create based on the primitives.
3. Use “Graph” paper to sketch your design to make it easier to set your coordinates.
4. Your unique bitmap image may take some time to design, generate and test. You should plan accordingly.

Deliverables

You should submit a well-organized Word document that includes:

1. Screen captures of the output of running your Visual C++ code
2. A description of the project that discusses how you incorporated each of the required items listed above and why you selected to do this application
3. A discussion of the limitations of the application and possible future enhancements
4. A user's guide that explains how to compile and run the application

You should submit the C++ source code files for your application in a .zip file.
